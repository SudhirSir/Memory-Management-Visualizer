# Memory-Management-Visualizer
Virtual Memory Optimization Challenge is designed to provide a detailed visualization of virtual memory management concepts such as paging, segmentation, page faults, demand paging, and page replacement algorithms. The tool enables users to input custom memory allocation parameters, simulate memory fragmentation, and analyze the performance of page replacement strategies like Least Recently Used (LRU) and Optimal.
This project implements a graphical user interface (GUI) to visualize the memory allocation process, track page faults, and simulate page replacement strategies using Python and Tkinter. The tool helps users understand how memory is managed and optimized in an operating system environment.
